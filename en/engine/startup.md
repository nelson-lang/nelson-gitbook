# startup

User-defined startup script for Nelson.

## Description

  <p><b>startup.m</b> in Nelson initiates user-specified commands upon Nelson startup.</p>
  <p>It executes any file named <b>startup.m</b> that is located on the search path.</p>
  <p>To leverage this feature, create a file named <b>startup.m</b> in the userpath folder, which is included in the Nelson search path.</p>
  <p>Embed commands within this file that you wish to be executed during Nelson startup.</p>
  <p>This could involve setting physical constants, defining defaults for graphics properties, incorporating engineering conversion factors, or predefining any other elements desired in your workspace.</p>
  <p>Customizing the <b>startup.m</b> file allows you to establish a tailored environment every time Nelson is launched.</p>
