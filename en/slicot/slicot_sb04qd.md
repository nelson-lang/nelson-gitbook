# slicot_sb04qd

Solution of discrete-time Sylvester equations (Hessenberg-Schur method).

## Syntax

- [A_OUT, B_OUT, C_OUT, Z, INFO] = slicot_sb04qd(A_IN, B_IN, C_IN)

## Input argument

- A_IN - The leading N-by-N part of this array must contain the coefficient matrix A of the equation.
- B_IN - The leading M-by-M part of this array must contain the coefficient matrix B of the equation.
- C_IN - The leading N-by-M part of this array must contain the coefficient matrix C of the equation.

## Output argument

- A_OUT - The leading N-by-N upper Hessenberg part of this array contains the matrix H, and the remainder of the leading N-by-N part, together with the elements 2,3,...,N of array DWORK, contain the orthogonal transformation matrix U (stored in factored form).
- B_OUT - The leading M-by-M part of this array contains the quasi-triangular Schur factor S of the matrix B'.
- C_OUT - The leading N-by-M part of this array contains the solution matrix X of the problem.
- Z - The leading M-by-M part of this array contains the orthogonal matrix Z used to transform B' to real upper Schur form.
- INFO - = 0: successful exit;

## Description

  <p>To solve for X the discrete-time Sylvester equation X + AXB = C, where A, B, C and X are general N-by-N, M-by-M, N-by-M and N-by-M matrices respectively. A Hessenberg-Schur method, which reduces A to upper Hessenberg form, H = U'AU, and B' to real Schur form, S = Z'B'Z (with U, Z orthogonal matrices), is used.</p>
