# nyquist

Nyquist plot of frequency response.

## Syntax

- nyquist(sys)
- nyquist(sys, w)
- [re, im, wout] = nyquist(sys)
- [re, im, wout] = nyquist(sys, w)

## Input argument

- sys - Dynamic system
- w - Frequencies: vector or {wmin,wmax}

## Output argument

- re - Real part of system response
- im - Imaginary part of system response
- wout - Frequencies

## Description

  <p>The Nyquist function, <b>nyquist(sys)</b>, generates a graphical representation known as a Nyquist plot, illustrating the frequency response of a dynamic system model represented by sys.</p>
  <p>This plot visualizes both the real and imaginary components of the system's response across varying frequencies.</p>
  <p>The contour depicted by nyquist encompasses both positive and negative frequencies.</p>
  <p>Additionally, the plot incorporates arrows that signify the direction of increasing frequency for each branch.</p>

## Examples

```matlab
f = figure();
sys = tf([1, 1, 3, 3], [1, -3, 3, -1])
nyquist(sys);
```

```matlab
H = tf([2 5 1], [1 2 3]);
[re, im, wout] = nyquist(H);
```

```matlab
f = figure();
      H = tf([2 5 1], [1 2 3]);
nyquist(H);
```
