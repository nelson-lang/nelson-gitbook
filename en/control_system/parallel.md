# parallel

Parallel connection of two models.

## Syntax

- sys = parallel(sys1, sys2)
- sys = parallel(sys1, sys2)

## Input argument

- sys1, sys2 - LTI models.

## Output argument

- sys - LTI model.

## Description

  <p><b>parallel</b> function links two model objects in parallel.</p>
  <p>It is versatile and can accept various types of models.</p>
  <p>However, for successful connection, both systems must share the same nature, being either continuous or discrete, and must have identical sample times.</p>
  <p>Static gains are treated as neutral and can be defined using regular matrices.</p>

## Example

```matlab
sys1 = tf([1 4], [8 2 1]);
sys2 = tf(1, [8 2 1]);
sys = parallel(sys2, sys2)
```
