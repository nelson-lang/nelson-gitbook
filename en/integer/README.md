integers type

## Description

These functions convert and store data to 1, 2 or 4 bytes integers.
These data types are especially useful to store big objects such as images.

- [int16](int16.md) - Converts to 16-bit signed integer.
- [int32](int32.md) - Converts to 32-bit signed integer.
- [int64](int64.md) - Converts to 64-bit signed integer.
- [int8](int8.md) - Converts to 8-bit signed integer.
- [intmax](intmax.md) - Return the largest integer that can be represented in an integer type.
- [intmin](intmin.md) - Return the smallest integer that can be represented in an integer type.
- [uint16](uint16.md) - Converts to 16-bit unsigned integer.
- [uint32](uint32.md) - Converts to 32-bit unsigned integer.
- [uint64](uint64.md) - Converts to 64-bit unsigned integer.
- [uint8](uint8.md) - Converts to 8-bit unsigned integer.
