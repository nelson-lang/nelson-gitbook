## 📤 Output argument

- h - UI object.

## 📄 Description


<b>h = uihtml()</b> creates a component that displays an HTML page inside a UI figure and exchanges data with it. 

<b>uihtml requires the WebView desktop.</b> Anywhere else it raises <b>Nelson:uihtml:webviewDesktopRequired</b>, because no page can be displayed there. Start the WebView desktop to use it. 

<b>HTMLSource</b> accepts two forms: HTML markup, or the name of an HTML file (relative or absolute). It is stored exactly as given. A URL is not accepted. 

The page must define a global <b>setup</b> function taking one argument. It runs once the content has loaded, and again whenever <b>HTMLSource</b> changes to a different value. Setting the same value again changes nothing. 

The object passed to <b>setup</b> carries the property <b>Data</b>, the methods <b>addEventListener</b> and <b>removeEventListener</b>, and the method <b>sendEventToNelson(name, data)</b>. Note that pages written for other environments name that last method differently and must be edited. 

Notification is asymmetric. Writing <b>Data</b> from Nelson raises the <b>DataChanged</b> event in the page and does <b>not</b> run <b>DataChangedFcn</b>. Writing it from the page runs <b>DataChangedFcn</b>, whose event carries <b>Data</b> and <b>PreviousData</b>, and is not sent back down. Writing a value equal to the current one notifies nobody. 

<b>Data</b> travels as JSON in both directions, so a value comes back as <b>jsonencode</b> followed by <b>jsondecode</b> leaves it: integers arrive as double, row vectors come back as columns, <b>datetime</b> and <b>categorical</b> arrive as text, and complex values cannot be sent at all. 

Use <b>sendEventToHTMLSource</b> to send a named event to the page; the page receives it through <b>addEventListener</b>. A page event reaches Nelson through <b>HTMLEventReceivedFcn</b>, whose event carries <b>HTMLEventName</b> and <b>HTMLEventData</b>. Page events are delivered in the order the page sent them. 

The page keeps its state while it is hidden, while its tab is not selected, and across a change of parent inside the desktop. Moving a figure between its own window and the docked desktop is not one of those: the page moves to another document and is rebuilt, and <b>setup</b> runs again. 

Write a page that can rebuild itself. <b>Data</b> keeps its value across such a rebuild, so read it in <b>setup</b> and render from it there, rather than waiting for <b>DataChanged</b> - a notification a fresh page has already missed. A page that only renders on <b>DataChanged</b> comes back empty, and re-running the handshake does not save it: writing the value already published notifies nobody.

## 💡 Example

a page that reads Data and answers with an event

```matlab

f = uifigure();
page = ['<html><body><p id="out">waiting</p><script>', ...
  'function setup(h) {', ...
  '  h.addEventListener("DataChanged", function () {', ...
  '    document.getElementById("out").textContent = JSON.stringify(h.Data);', ...
  '  });', ...
  '  h.sendEventToNelson("ready", {});', ...
  '}</script></body></html>'];
h = uihtml(f, 'Position', [10 10 400 200], 'HTMLSource', page);
h.HTMLEventReceivedFcn = @(src, evt) disp(evt.HTMLEventName);
h.Data = struct('temperature', 21.5);

```
