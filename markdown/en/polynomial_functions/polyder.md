# polyder

Polynomial differentiation.

## Syntax

- k = polyder(p)
- k = polyder(a, b)
- [q, d] = polyder(a, b)

## Input argument

- p - vector: polynomial coefficients
- a - row vector: polynomial coefficients
- b - row vector: polynomial coefficients

## Output argument

- k - row vector: differentiated polynomial coefficients
- q - row vector: numerator polynomial
- d - row vector: denominator polynomial

## Description

<p>
            <b>k = polyder(p)</b> return the coefficients of the derivative of the polynomial whose coefficients are given by the vector <b>p</b>.</p>
<p>
                <b>k = polyder(a, b) </b>  returns the derivative of the product of the polynomials <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>.</p>
<p>
                    <b>[q, d] = polyder(a, b)</b> returns the derivative of the quotient of the polynomials <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>.</p>

## Example

```matlab

p = [30 0 -20 0 10 50];
q = polyder(p)
```
