# Time functions

The Time Functions module provides tools for working with dates, times, and durations in Nelson.

It supports querying the current time, measuring elapsed time, performing calculations on dates and times, converting between different time representations, and handling calendar-specific operations such as leap years and month-end calculations.

This module enables precise time management, scheduling, and performance measurement in scripts and applications.
