# clock

Return the current local date and time as a date vector.

## Syntax

- v = clock()

## Output argument

- v - a vector: [year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds].

## Description

  <p><b>calendar()</b> returns the currently monthly calendar.</p>
  <p>The date vector contains the following fields:</p>
  <p>year</p>
  <p>months [1, 12]</p>
  <p>days [1, 31]</p>
  <p>hours [0, 23]</p>
  <p>minutes [0, 59]</p>
  <p>seconds [0, 61]</p>
  <p>seconds: field has a fractional part after the decimal point for extended accuracy.</p>
  <p>To time the duration of an event, use tic and toc functions instead of clock.</p>
  <p>The clock function is based on the system time and thus might not be reliable for time comparison operations.</p>

## Example

```matlab
c = clock()
fix(c)
```
