# quit

Terminate Nelson application

## 📝 Syntax

- quit
- quit(status)
- quit('force')
- quit('cancel')
- quit(status, 'force')

## 📄 Description

<b>quit</b> terminates current Nelson application.

<b>quit('cancel')</b> command is designed specifically for utilization within a finish.m script, preventing the termination process.

Its functionality is restricted to this context.

On the other hand, <b>quit('force')</b> disregards the finish.m script and immediately concludes Nelson.

Employ this syntax when you need to override the finish script, ensuring a smooth exit in case the script poses obstacles to quitting.

When you utilize <b>quit(code)</b>, Nelson exits with the specified value as the exit code.

If you append "force" to this command <b>quit(code, 'force')</b> it enforces an immediate termination, bypassing finish.m and incorporating the provided exit code.

The exit code, denoted by "code" and specified as a signed integer, determines the status of Nelson termination.

On Windows® platforms, Nelson furnishes exit codes within the range of INT_MIN to INT_MAX (-2147483647 to 2147483647).

On Linux® and macOS platforms, Nelson confines exit codes to the range of 0 to 255.

This distinction should be considered when interpreting or handling exit codes in Nelson scripts or processes.

## 💡 Example

Beware this example will close Nelson
