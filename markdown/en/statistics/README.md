# Statistics

The Statistics module provides tools for analyzing and summarizing data in Nelson.

It includes functions for computing measures of central tendency, variability, correlation, and probability distributions.

The module also supports advanced data summarization structures for accurate quantile estimation, enabling robust statistical analysis and interpretation of datasets.

## Functions

- [corrcoef](corrcoef.md) - Correlation coefficients
- [cov](cov.md) - Covariance
- [mean](mean.md) - Mean of array elements.
- [normpdf](normpdf.md) - Normal probability density function
- [tdigest](tdigest.md) - t-digest algorithm data structure for accurate quantile estimation with configurable compression parameters
- [var](var.md) - Variance
