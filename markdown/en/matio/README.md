# MATIO

The MATIO module provides support for reading and writing MAT-files, a widely used format for storing numerical data in MATLAB© and compatible environments.

It enables Nelson to check MAT-file validity, load and save workspace variables, and inspect file contents.

With this module, users can exchange data between Nelson and MATLAB©, making it a key component for interoperability in scientific and engineering workflows.

## Functions

- [ismatfile](ismatfile.md) - Checks if filename a valid .mat file
- [loadmat](loadmat.md) - load data from .mat file into Nelson's workspace.
- [savemat](savemat.md) - save workspace variables to .mat file
- [whomat](whomat.md) - List variables in an valid .mat file.
- [whosmat](whosmat.md) - List variables in an valid .mat file with sizes and types.
