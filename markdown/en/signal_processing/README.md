# Signal Processing

The Signal Processing module provides tools for analyzing and manipulating sampled signals in Nelson.

It includes windowing functions, digital filtering, cross-correlation, and conversions between magnitude, power, and decibel representations.

The module also supports transformation between zero-pole representations and transfer functions, enabling efficient design and analysis of discrete-time signal processing systems.
