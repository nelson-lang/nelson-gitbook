# slicot_ab07nd

Inverse of a given linear system.

## Syntax

- [A_OUT, B_OUT, C_OUT, D_OUT, RCOND, INFO] = slicot_ab07nd(A_IN, B_IN, C_IN, D_IN)

## Input argument

- A_IN - The leading N-by-N part of this array must contain the state matrix A of the original system.
- B_IN - The leading N-by-M part of this array must contain the input matrix B of the original system.
- C_IN - The leading M-by-N part of this array must contain the output matrix C of the original system.
- D_IN - The leading M-by-M part of this array must contain the feedthrough matrix D of the original system.

## Output argument

- A_OUT - The leading N-by-N part of this array contains the state matrix Ai of the inverse system.
- B_OUT - The leading N-by-M part of this array contains the input matrix Bi of the inverse system.
- C_OUT - The leading M-by-N part of this array contains the output matrix Ci of the inverse system.
- D_OUT - The leading M-by-M part of this array contains the feedthrough matrix Di of the inverse system.
- RCOND - The estimated reciprocal condition number of the feedthrough matrix D of the original system.
- INFO - = 0: successful exit;
