# Fortran to C

The F2C module allows Nelson users to convert legacy Fortran 77 source files into C code.

This enables seamless integration of older Fortran routines into Nelson workflows,
supporting compilation, execution, and interaction with Nelson variables.

It is particularly useful for leveraging existing numerical algorithms or legacy
scientific codebases within a modern Nelson environment.
