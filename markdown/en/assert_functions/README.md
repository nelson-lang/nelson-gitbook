# Assertion functions

The Asserts Functions module in Nelson provides tools for validating program behavior and
verifying conditions during development or testing.

These functions help ensure that computations and logical conditions meet expected criteria,
improving code reliability and catching errors early.

## Functions

- [assert](assert.md) - Check that condition is true.
- [assert_checkerror](assert_checkerror.md) - Check that an command raises the expected error.
- [assert_isapprox](assert_isapprox.md) - Check that computed and expected values are approximately equal.
- [assert_isequal](assert_isequal.md) - Check that computed and expected values are equal.
- [assert_isfalse](assert_isfalse.md) - Check that condition is false.
- [assert_istrue](assert_istrue.md) - Check that condition is true.
