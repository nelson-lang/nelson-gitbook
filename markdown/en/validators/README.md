# Validators

The Validators module provides tools for enforcing constraints and verifying input values in Nelson.

It supports checking data types, numerical properties, matrix and vector dimensions, text validity, file and folder existence, and logical or numeric conditions.

This module ensures robust input validation, helping to prevent errors, enforce correctness, and improve the reliability of scripts and functions.
