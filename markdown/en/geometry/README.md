# Geometry

The Geometry module provides tools for performing geometric transformations and computations in Nelson.

It supports rotation operations in three-dimensional space, enabling the construction of transformation matrices for manipulating objects and coordinate systems.

This module is useful for applications in computer graphics, robotics, and spatial analysis.

## Functions

- [rotx](rotx.md) - 3x3 transformation matrix for rotations around x-axis
- [roty](roty.md) - 3x3 transformation matrix for rotations around y-axis
- [rotz](rotz.md) - 3x3 transformation matrix for rotations around z-axis
