# Julia Nelson types

Managing Data between Julia and Nelson.

## 📄 Description

<b>Managing data returned by Julia functions:</b>

This documentation explains how data is managed and converted between Julia and Nelson. It covers scalar, vector, and matrix conversions, examples of usage, and related resources.

| Julia return type, as shown in Julia | Corresponding Nelson type (scalar) |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Bool                                 | logical                            |
| Complex{Float64}                     | double (complex)                   |
| Complex{Float32}                     | single (complex)                   |
| Float64                              | double                             |
| Float32                              | single                             |
| Int8                                 | int8                               |
| Int16                                | int16                              |
| Int32                                | int32                              |
| Int64                                | int64                              |
| UInt8                                | uint8                              |
| UInt16                               | uint16                             |
| UInt32                               | uint32                             |
| UInt64                               | uint64                             |
| String                               | string                             |

Vector and Matrix of Nelson type returned as matrix in Julia.

<b>cell</b> converted to <b>Array{Any}</b>.

<b>struct</b> converted to <b>Dict{Any, Any}</b>.

matrix of struct converted to <b>Matrix{Dict}</b>.

<b>dictionary</b> converted to <b>Dict{Any, Any}</b>.

Ensure that all data passed between Julia and Nelson adheres to the type mappings described above for smooth conversions.

For advanced use cases, such as handling custom Julia types or deeply nested data structures, additional preprocessing in Julia or Nelson may be required.

## 💡 Examples

```matlab
R = jlrun('', "A", 'A', magic(3))
R.double()
```

```matlab
names = ["Unicycle" "Bicycle" "Tricycle"];
wheels = [1 2 3];
d = dictionary(wheels,names)
R = jlrun('', "A", 'A', d)

```
