# Overloading

The Overloading module provides mechanisms for customizing the behavior of functions and operators in Nelson.

It allows users to define how standard operations or built-in functions should behave when applied to user-defined types or objects.

This capability enables the extension of Nelson’s language features, supporting more natural and expressive use of custom data structures.
