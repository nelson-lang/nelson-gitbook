# ctrb

Controllability of state-space model.

## Syntax

- Co = ctrb(A, B)
- Co = ctrb(sys)

## Input argument

- sys - State-space model
- A - State matrix: Nx-by-Nx matrix
- B - Input-to-state matrix: Nx-by-Nu matrix

## Output argument

- Co - Controllability matrix.

## Description

<p>Controllability in a dynamic system refers to the system's ability to be guided to any desired state within a finite timeframe through the application of suitable control signals.</p>

<p>This property is commonly known as reachability.</p>

<p>The function ctrb is employed to calculate a controllability matrix, either from state matrices or a state-space model.</p>

<p>The resulting matrix serves as a tool to assess and confirm the controllability of the system.</p>

## Example

```matlab
A = [1 2; 0 3];
B = [1; 1];
C = eye(2);
D = zeros(2, 1);
sys = ss(A, B, C, D);
Co = ctrb(sys)
```
