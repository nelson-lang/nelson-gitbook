# dsort

Sort discrete-time poles by magnitude.

## Syntax

- s = dsort(p)
- [s, ndx] = dsort(p)

## Input argument

- p - p: a vector

## Output argument

- s - sorted vector by magnitude.

## Description

<p>dsort arranges the discrete-time poles within the vector p in a descending order based on their magnitude, with unstable poles taking precedence at the beginning of the sorted list.</p>

## Example

```matlab
p = [-2.410 + 5.573i;
-2.410 - 5.573i;
1.503;
-0.972;
-2.590];
[s, ndx] = dsort(p)


```
