# Memory manager functions

The Memory Manager module provides tools for managing variables and memory in Nelson.

It supports variable creation, assignment, querying, and removal across different scopes, as well as handling global and persistent variables.

The module also enables memory inspection, variable locking, and listing of workspace contents, facilitating efficient and controlled memory usage in scripts and applications.
