# Spreadsheet

The Spreadsheet module provides functions for reading and writing tabular data from and to text-based spreadsheet formats, such as CSV and delimiter-separated files.

It supports importing into various data types like numeric arrays, cell arrays, and tables, as well as exporting them back to files.

This enables smooth interaction with spreadsheet software (Excel, LibreOffice Calc, etc.) and data exchange between applications.
