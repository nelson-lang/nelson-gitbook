integers type

## Description
These functions convert and store data to 1, 2 or 4 bytes integers.
		These data types are especially useful to store big objects such as images.


* [int16](int16.md) - Converts to 16-bit signed integer.
* [int32](int32.md) - Converts to 32-bit signed integer.
* [int64](int64.md) - Converts to 64-bit signed integer.
* [int8](int8.md) - Converts to 8-bit signed integer.
* [intmax](intmax.md) - Return the largest integer that can be represented in an integer type.
* [intmin](intmin.md) - Return the smallest integer that can be represented in an integer type.
* [uint16](uint16.md) - Converts to 16-bit unsigned integer.
* [uint32](uint32.md) - Converts to 32-bit unsigned integer.
* [uint64](uint64.md) - Converts to 64-bit unsigned integer.
* [uint8](uint8.md) - Converts to 8-bit unsigned integer.
